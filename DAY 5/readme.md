# CMOS Power Supply and Device Variation Robustness Evaluation


## Static Behaviour Evaluation ‚Äî Power Supply Variation

**Overview:**

Power supply scaling affects the **static behavior** of CMOS inverters, including:

* Switching threshold voltage (**Vm**)
* Noise margins (**NML/NMH**)
* Overall circuit robustness

**Simulation Setup:**

* CMOS inverter simulated at multiple supply voltages: `Vdd = 2.5V ‚Üí 1V`
* PMOS/NMOS transistor sizes remain constant: `Wp = 0.9375 Œºm`, `Wn = 0.375 Œºm`

**Observations:**

| Parameter                    | Observation                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Switching Threshold (Vm)** | Moves toward center of supply range as Vdd decreases                  |
| **Noise Margins**            | Shrink with lower Vdd, reducing tolerance to input noise              |
| **Performance**              | Low Vdd reduces power consumption but may slow switching speed        |
| **Trade-off**                | High Vdd improves noise margin but increases static and dynamic power |

**Design Insight:**

* Power scaling is a key method for **low-power CMOS design**.
* Designers must balance **energy efficiency** with **noise immunity** and **speed**.

## How to Calculate Gain from SPICE VTC Plot

The **gain of a CMOS inverter** can be derived from the **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** plot obtained in SPICE:

1. Click on the **PMOS slope** (left side of transition) ‚Äî Terminal displays:
   `x0 = Vin`, `y0 = Vout`
2. Click on the **NMOS slope** (right side of transition) ‚Äî Terminal displays:
   `x1 = Vin`, `y1 = Vout`
3. Compute the **gain**:

[
\text{Gain} = \frac{y0 - y1}{x0 - x1}
]

> Gain represents the **steepness of the VTC transition**, indicating how sharply the inverter switches from logic '1' to '0'.

## Device Variation and CMOS Inverter Robustness

Device variation is a **critical factor in determining inverter robustness**, caused by **process fluctuations** during fabrication. The most common variations include:

* **Etching Variation** (affects transistor dimensions W and L)
* **Oxide Thickness Variation (Tox)** (affects gate capacitance and threshold voltage)

These variations directly influence the **switching threshold (Vm)**, **noise margins**, and **overall reliability** of the inverter.
